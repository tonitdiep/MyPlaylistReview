# Rails Project README
Welcome to MyPlaylistReview for Rails Module 3 Project. 
In MyPlaylistReview app, we are creating, reviewing and organizing how these playlists and reviews entries are(journal style) are accessed and displayed as a Content Management System (CMS). Now we are intricately building complex forms and RESTful routes to manage our database, utilizing nested routes, scopes and validations to test and query our database.  By integrating the database usage from ActiveRecord models associatios (belongs_to's and has_many through's), requires a complexity in mapping out the MVC structure and RESTful routes that are DRY and efficiently managed and experienced for both the developer and clients.
 
## Installation
Before you run this, be sure to run 'bundle install'.

To run this, please 'type', "rails s", into the terminal to start the server, and Sign Up as a new user to interact with the application.

## Development
From the text editor terminal run these commands: 
Run "rails c" to test objects in the console. 

Run "rails c -s" to test the objects in the console in a sandbox without storing unnecessary test objects into the database. 

Run "rails s" to start the server. 

Lately, Enter "Control + C" to stop the server. 

Run "rails routes" to see it in the text editor terminal or go to http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes to there while running the app in the browser. 

Run "byebug" "binding.pry" through "rails s" to test on specific lines of code and its params. 

Most importantly, test errors are always helpful hints from both the browser page and text editor while building this app.
